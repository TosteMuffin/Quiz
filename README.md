# Quiz
This program is a preset quiz I wrote in C++. It is a multiple choice quiz based on some pretty simple algebra.

Changelog

Version 1.0: Just a rough baseline for me to build off of.

Version 1.1: I added 3 more questions to the quiz and added a results module, as well as a results calculator.

Version 1.2: I added a new module to welcome the user, and I changed and updated the results module to give more custom messages based on the amount of correct answers.

Version 1.3: I changed the welcome module to only allow users who follw directions to take the quiz, if they don't follow directions it displays invalid and returns the              prompt until they comply.

Version2.0: This version was a massive overhaul to my original design (hence why it jumped from 1.3 to 2.0). In this version I completely changed how the quiz was taken, you can only answer a, b, c, or d, for the questions otherwise it gives you an error and then repeats the question. I have added 4 new modules that serve as checks to see if the user entered the correct answer, if so, it then adds to total. I also slightly edited the results module making it slightly more personal.
